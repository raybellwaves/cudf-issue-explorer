Please describe.**\r\nWe have seen cases where allocating many thousands of pinned memory buffers causes very poor performance in the Java `PinnedMemoryPool` allocator.  That allocator currently performs a linear coalesce scan on free which performs decently when there aren't many allocations but does not scale well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe pinned memory pool should minimally use a logarithmic, heap-like algorithm for managing the address space, or possibly a bucketing technique with hashing.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjc4NzQxMw==","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
