Please describe.**\r\nThe current minhashes functionality/API #12961  computes minhashes by taking a fixed character width sliding window and computes the minhashes for a document using character ngrams.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative approach to minhashing documents is to instead use word based ngrams instead of char based and research seems to suggest it leads to better quality results (lower false positives during Locality sensitive hashing). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a word ngram based minhash support that's accelerated on GPUs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently most CPU libraries achieve this by first tokenizing the string into word ngrams, and then looping over these tokens computing the minhash. \r\nIt is possible to somewhat mimic that with a `str.word_tokenize + str.hash_values + groupby + min` in cuDF but requires a lot more intermediate memory and reduces the batch size of documents processed. It is also slower than a custom minhash implementation.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is that the definition of a \"word\" can be different for different languages and there's often different approaches to create word_ngrams based on language.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context, code examples, or references to existing implementations about the feature request here.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-14T19:43:47Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5_Qrhn","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTE1NjE2MjUz","name":"strings","description":"strings issues (C++ and Python)","color":"0e8a16"}],"milestone":{"number":30,"title":"Language model acceleration","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":15055,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Word ngram based minhashes","updatedAt":"2024-02-15T18:33:18Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15055"}
