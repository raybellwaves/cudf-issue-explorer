Provide a way to indicate there is no header information in metadata. It's possible to fix this issue at Cython/Python layer. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nPR Comment  https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/12498#discussion_r1070188657\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5TSsfv","author":{"login":"vuule"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@galipremsagar this looks like a Python feature.
