This value is useful for comparing benchmarks because it normalizes the increasing execution time from processing more data. Also, `bytes_per_second` and `real_time_s` together let us compute `bytes_processed` values which serve as a useful Y-axis.\r\n\r\nAs of the end of 23.12 development, many benchmarks still do not report `bytes_per_second` in the output data. Here is a figure summarizing the metrics reported by the benchmark suite.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/assets/12725111/aeb8176c-e869-4200-83aa-074aa4aaee5a)\r\n\r\n| benchmark | status | notes | \r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|`APPLY_BOOLEAN_MASK` | | see #13937 | \r\n| `BINARYOP` | | see #13938 |\r\n| `COPY_IF_ELSE` | | see #13960 |\r\n| `GROUPBY` | | see #13984 |\r\n| `GROUPBY_NV` | | |\r\n| `HASHING` | | see #13967, #13965|\r\n| `JOIN` | | |\r\n| `JOIN_NV` | | |\r\n| `QUANTILES` | | |\r\n| `REDUCTION` | | |\r\n| `REPLACE` | | |\r\n| `SEARCH` | | |\r\n| `SEARCH_NV` | | |\r\n| `SET_OPS_NV` | | |\r\n| `SHIFT` | | see #13950 |\r\n| `SORT` | | |\r\n| `SORT_NV` | | |\r\n| `STREAM_COMPACTION_NV` | | see #14172 |\r\n| `TRANSPOSE` | | see #14170 |\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: For this tracking list, cuIO benchmarks are omitted because \"encoded file size\" serves a similar purpose.
