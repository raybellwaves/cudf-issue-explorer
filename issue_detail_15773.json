A good amount of this overhead seems to stem from the fact that we're simply launching many tiny kernels.  It might be useful to have a batched/multi memset kernel that takes a list of address/sizes/values as a single input and does all the work under a single kernel launch.  Similar to the Cub multi-buffer memcpy or `contiguous_split`.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-17T15:43:03Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6JRdf8","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzIyMjUyNjE3","name":"Performance","description":"Performance related issue","color":"C2E0C6"}],"milestone":null,"number":15773,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Potential optimization:  Batched memset.","updatedAt":"2024-05-19T03:42:51Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15773"}
