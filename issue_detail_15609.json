I think we could re-evaluate the contents of that script. The downside would be that users having installation troubles wouldn't be able to import the package to call such a function -- but the environment information might still be helpful for diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems to me that many users skip the step of reporting environment information, so either the `print_env.sh` script is hard to find or issue reporters don't think it is important.\r\n\r\nxref: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15589#issuecomment-2083061696","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps58NOBq","author":{"login":"galipremsagar"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we should have similar api support like `import pandas as pd; pd.show_versions()`","createdAt":"2024-04-29T23:13:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15609#issuecomment-2083840106","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps58NR-X","author":{"login":"bdice"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I love that idea.
