Please describe.**\r\nWhen calling the method _cudf.read_csv_, the _sep_ argument only accepts a 1 character string - which was an old issue in pandas. However, they have already included support for multi-character separators and it would be a useful thing to have on cudf.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCalling the _cudf.read_csv_ method as \r\n\r\n```python\r\ncudf.read_csv(filepath, sep='::')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPerhaps allowing users to use a regex as a separator definer would provide a more robust solution.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nPython code example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport cudf\r\n\r\nfilepath = './example.csv'\r\nwith open(filepath, 'w') as f:\r\n    f.write('column0::column1\\n')\r\n    f.write('value00::value01\\n')\r\n    f.write('value10::value11\\n')\r\n\r\ndf_pandas = pd.read_csv(filepath, sep='::')\r\nprint ('Loaded csv file from pandas')\r\ndf_cudf = cudf.read_csv(filepath, sep='::')\r\nprint ('Loaded csv file from cudf')\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent output: `ValueError: only single character unicode strings can be converted to Py_UCS4, got length 2`","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps49b2nC","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
