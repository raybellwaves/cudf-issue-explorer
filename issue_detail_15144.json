Please describe.**\r\nUnfortunately there has been churn in libcudf around support for `num_rows`/`skiprows` in the Parquet and ORC readers. In 22.08 we deprecated these parameters in the parquet reader (#11218) and then in 22.10 we removed them from C++ (#11503) and python (#11480). We also deprecated `num_rows`/`skiprows` in the ORC reader (#11522, see issue #11519).\r\n\r\nAt this point, we realized that chunked parquet reading (#11867) would require adding `num_rows`/`skiprows` back to the C++ implementation (#11657).\r\n\r\nLet's stabilize row selection APIs in libcudf by completing these tasks:\r\n- [ ] Add python bindings in the parquet reader for `num_rows`/`skiprows`\r\n- [ ] Remove the deprecation notice in the ORC reader for `num_rows`/`skiprows` (#11522)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe also dropped `num_rows`/`skiprows` support in the cuDF-python fuzz tests (#11505). My preference is to not include any python fuzz testing changes in the scope of this issue.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-26T19:36:33Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6Acjmu","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE2MzMyOTQ4","name":"good first issue","description":"Good for newcomers","color":"7057ff"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQ0MTQy","name":"cuIO","description":"cuIO issue","color":"fef2c0"}],"milestone":{"number":22,"title":"Parquet continuous improvement","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":15144,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Add python bindings in the parquet reader for `num_rows`/`skiprows`","updatedAt":"2024-02-28T18:46:51Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15144"}
