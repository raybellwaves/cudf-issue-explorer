I've asked for clarification of this here https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/56137, since it is _only_ `union` that uses the multiset definitions.\r\n\r\ncudf, in contrast, performs the union as an outer join. Which produces multiplicities that are the product of the multiplicities of the left and right indexes (with identity for missing values of 1). This matches the pandas behaviour in the case where all entries have multiplicity greater than one in exactly one of the left or right indexes. However, if an entry has a multiplicity larger than one in both left and right indexes, we get the wrong answer.\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport cudf\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nleft = pd.Index([1, 1])\r\nright = pd.Index([1, 2, 1, 1])\r\nprint(left.union(right))\r\n\r\ncleft = cudf.from_pandas(left)\r\ncright = cudf.from_pandas(right)\r\n\r\nprint(cleft.union(cright))\r\n# Int64Index([1, 1, 1, 2], dtype='int64')\r\n# Int64Index([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], dtype='int64')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nMatch pandas.\r\n\r\nThis can be done with `value_counts`/`merge`/`repeat` in some combo, but there's probably a slightly smarter way.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nAlso applies to `MultiIndex`.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-23T17:23:39Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps53uOdQ","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NTk=","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQxMjEz","name":"cuDF (Python)","description":"Affects Python cuDF API.","color":"1d76db"}],"milestone":{"number":5,"title":"Pandas API Alignment and Coverage","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":14488,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] `Index.union` does not match pandas for indexes with duplicate entries","updatedAt":"2024-05-16T05:12:34Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14488"}
