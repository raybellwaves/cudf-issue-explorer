The problem with this API is that as soon as an attempt is made to put host data onto the GPU, the host data is put in a try-with-resources block that closes it. If the creation of the GPU data fails, or a subsequent column in a batch fails to materialize, we cannot retry it (ColumnBuilder does not allow me to build an idempotent BatchBuilder).\r\n\r\nThis task is to likely add a BatchBuilder that allows us to control when/if the host data is freed, so we can work in retry semantics like https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7851.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-06T23:24:50Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5gGymE","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ1NjIz","name":"cuDF (Java)","description":"Affects Java cuDF API.","color":"006b75"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ2OTc1","name":"Spark","description":"Functionality that helps Spark RAPIDS","color":"7400ff"}],"milestone":null,"number":12889,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA][JNI] Add an API that allows us to build batches on the GPU from host columns","updatedAt":"2023-06-06T05:05:48Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12889"}
