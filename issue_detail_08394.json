However, this led to a separate edge case, which is determining what data type to return when performing a UDF aggregation that returns an empty column. A numba-compiled Python UDF provides enough information to infer the output type, but we need to assess the extent to which UDFs returning nested are/should be supported in cudf Python to determine whether/how to pass this information down to `libcudf` to ensure that the appropriate types are returned. As of #8274 such aggregations simply mimic the input data type for the returned column.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xqHb","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
