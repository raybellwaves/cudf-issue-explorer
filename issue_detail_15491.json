There is a piece of code where we are checking types directly against a key type. I want to refactor this so that the columns can be correctly compared to the key type if either is a nested type. This requires using `cudf::types_equal` as implemented in #14531, but the refactoring needed was too large and thus I left it out of scope for that PR.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/c91df106f55b68068e9f1b4cf977fbe5257ea9b3/cpp/src/dictionary/detail/concatenate.cu#L223-L224\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14531/files#diff-e57bb56f60427be2c2bab0e098d9c965996d0516867693372f72982ecb319cfeR223","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-04-09T18:55:37Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6FKfSU","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":15491,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Use nested type-checking in dictionary concatenate","updatedAt":"2024-04-09T19:01:02Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15491"}
