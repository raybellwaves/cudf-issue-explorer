(installs  MSVC C++ and Windows SDK )\r\n- Install CUDA SDK (required version - I used CUDA 11.2).\r\n\r\n- conda/environments/cudf_dev_cuda11.2.yml\r\n  -  remove rmm, dlpack (not available for windows)\r\n\r\nIn Cmake installation in Windows, patch.exe was missing, so I installed cygwin and installed cmake. (added to PATH)\r\n(patch.exe required for thrust patch in cudf).\r\n\r\nset paths\r\n```\r\nset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.2\\bin\\\r\nsetx CUDAToolkit_ROOT \"C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.2\"\r\nset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\cygwin64\\bin\r\nconda activate cudf_dev\r\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x86_amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cmake\r\n\r\n`cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=70 ..`\r\n\r\nComment out `cudftestutil` build part (This should be inside `BUILD_TESTS` flag) \r\nNote: gtest, gmock find package failed. So, can't build tests.\r\n\r\nAdd\r\n```\r\nlist(APPEND CUDF_CUDA_FLAGS -Xcompiler=-Wall,-Werror,-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations)\r\nlist(APPEND CUDF_CUDA_FLAGS -Xcompiler=-rdynamic)\r\n```\r\nto disable max, min macros, add `-DNOMINMAX` in CXX flags\r\n\r\nrmm MACROs has issue with windows. remove these macro usages, or simplify macros to allow msvc to compile. Issue could be due to `__VA_ARGS__`. (will commit the patch in new branch).\r\n\r\nnvcomp compiles in C++14 by default. So, set its standard to C++17 in its own cmakelists.txt inside `_deps/nvcomp-src`\r\n```\r\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\r\nset(CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD 17)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Compilation issues (Mostly MSVC issues)\r\nI have listed only few of the issues here. Lot more issues are faced and hacks need to done to proceed with compilation.\r\n\r\nIn `_deps\\libcudacxx-src`\r\n“libcxx\\include“ softlink of linux does not work. So copied folder.\r\n\r\nJittify did not work. Disabled in cmakelists.txt\r\n- so, jit binops, transform, rolling, UDF. won't work.\r\nCommented out and disabled their codes. CUDF_FAIL.\r\n\r\nnot, and, or - keyword-like forms logical operators\r\n`#include <iso646.h> or <ciso646>`\r\n\r\nFor some reason, some of the enums did not work. My guess is they might be macros. They had to be renamed.\r\nFor example, `gather_bitmask_op::PASSTHROUGH2`, `io_type ::VOID2`, `concatenate_null_policy ::IGNORE2`, `parse_result:: ERROR2`\r\n\r\nreplace `std::nan(` with `nan(`\r\n\r\n[Bug](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/sfinae-with-constexpr-on-return-type-fails-to-comp/1590693) in MSVC – enable_if_t<constexpr_function()> error. So, converted them to “if constexpr else” blocks. Lot of manual work. (update: looks like the issue is fixed internally in MSVC, fix could be coming in future release)\r\n\r\nreplace\r\n`__builtin_bswap32` with `_byteswap_ulong`\r\n`__builtin_bswap64` with `_byteswap_uint64`\r\n\r\ncmath issue: constexpr function are not mandatory for std library in C++17. so, cmath does not have constexpr.\r\nmost device functions in cudf uses these math functions, with `--expt-relaxed-constexpr` flag.\r\nSo, Added a hack to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.29.30133\\include\\cmath`\r\n```\r\n#if _HAS_CXX17\r\n#define C17CONSTEXPR constexpr \r\n#else\r\n#define C17CONSTEXPR\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nAnd added `C17CONSTEXPR` to macros  `_GENERIC_MATH1_BASE` and `_GENERIC_MATH2_BASE`\r\nfew linux headers disabled in windows.\r\n\r\nSort, Stable sort took the most time and memory to compile!\r\nCompiling separately for 1.5 hours each. Each taking more than 51 GB peak memory!\r\n\r\n### Linking issues\r\ndelete contents of `fatbin.ld`\r\nget the link command by verbose compilation and link manually.\r\ndl.lib not found (conda doesn't have it). so remove from command.\r\nAlso, I didn't know how to use dll in other programs. So, I linked cudf to .lib instead of .dll. Use `lib.exe`\r\n\r\nSince many symbols are missing, Use `/FORCE:UNRESOLVED` for undefined symbols.\r\ncudf.lib >2GB and it did not detect during further example compilations. So, I opened `objects.rsp` and removed large object files such as `reductions/*.cu.obj` and then generated cudf.lib\r\n\r\nTested with simple sequence column, `cudf::repeat`, sum aggregation - both reduction and groupby. The test code worked!\r\n\r\n## Final words\r\nThis report is the tip of the iceberg. You will face a lot more issues while compiling.\r\nI have more notes and hints that I took during compilation. Also, many part of the code were disabled, so to get full functionality of libcudf, a lot more work is required to enable MSVC to compile the host code.\r\nBesides this, nvcc compilation resulting device ptx were different in Windows (often bigger). So, the code performance will likely be different from linux version that we currently support.","createdAt":"2022-05-10T15:27:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":5}}],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/28#issuecomment-1122544127","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5VGxiE","author":{"login":"niltecedu"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi guys,\r\n\r\nSo is there another/branch where someone is developing native windows, I would love to contribute to it!
