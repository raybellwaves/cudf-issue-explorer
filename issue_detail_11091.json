On the other hand, when we just do one table operations like comparing or hashing rows of the same table, we typically don't need these strong types.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes we actually need to support strong types in these self- operations. For example, we create a hash map with strong index types. In such cases, row comparator and hasher need to operate on strong index types.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5EsbHg","author":{"login":"ttnghia"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CC @bdice for awareness.","createdAt":"2022-06-10T15:42:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/11091#issuecomment-1152496096","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5GUaEF","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
