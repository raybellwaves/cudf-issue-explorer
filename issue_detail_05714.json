Please describe.**\r\nThe `np.object` data type is used within cuDF python to represent string data, but this doesn't really mirror the purpose or function of `object` datatypes in CPU based python libraries, particularly numpy and pandas which can work with truly general python objects. This results in a lot of special handling in certain places in the python code as well as giving the wrong impression to users about our handling of python objects. We should replace it with something better, possibly an extension type similar to list/categorical in the short term. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nReplace `np.object` in the cuDF codebase with a `cudf.StringDtype` object.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could also try and shoehorn `pd.StringDtype()` in instead or wait and handle this as part of a wider `cud.Dtype` effort.\r\n\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODk2MjMwNw==","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
