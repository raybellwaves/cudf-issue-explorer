From host or from device buffers.\r\n\r\nCurrently `HostMemoryBuffer` does allow wholesale copies of device buffers, and even using a stream, but there is no way I can find to do this at an offset. I can think of ways of hacking around it, but it would be best if the APIs were similar for both buffer types.
