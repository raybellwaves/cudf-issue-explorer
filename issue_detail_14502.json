Please describe.**\r\nDue to the wrapping behavior in cudf.pandas it can be very difficult to debug issues, and even more challenging to identify performance bottlenecks that arise from seemingly trivial functions triggering highly nontrivial behavior under the hood due to wrapped function calls.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be very helpful if the proxy objects supported tracing of proxied function calls that show when and how often arguments are being transferred from slow to fast libs and vice versa. This trace would give visibility into the true stack trace rather than the obfuscated trace produced by inspecting the proxied call stack.
