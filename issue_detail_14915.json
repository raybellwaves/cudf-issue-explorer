Please describe.**\r\n`dask` has a behavioral change when `pandas-2.x` & `pyarrow` are installed. Some APIs try switching `object` type columns to `arrow[string]` for efficiencies arrow strings provide over object types in pandas.  This causes a lot of pytest failures in `dask_cudf`, that is currently being prevented by configured a `dask.config`: `dataframe.convert-string` to `False`.  However, this only happens properly for `dask.DataFrame`'s and not for `dask_cudf.DataFrame`'s. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need to update `cudf` & `dask` upstream to get this support for `dask_cudf.DataFrame` as well when the device object is converted to host objects.\r\n\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-29T13:04:21Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps59frro","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQxMjEz","name":"cuDF (Python)","description":"Affects Python cuDF API.","color":"1d76db"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQwODk4","name":"dask","description":"Dask issue","color":"fcc25d"},{"id":"LA_kwDOBWUGps8AAAABlj4eYg","name":"cudf.pandas","description":"Issues specific to cudf.pandas","color":"984DFB"}],"milestone":{"number":36,"title":"cudf.pandas API coverage","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":14915,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Properly interface with `dask` `object` -> `arrow[string]` conversions","updatedAt":"2024-04-12T16:58:20Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14915"}
