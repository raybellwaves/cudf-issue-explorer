Please describe.**\r\nRMM can create log output which defaults to output in `rmm_log.txt`.  There currently isn't a way to connect this output to the other logging output from cudf which is currently funneled through the slf4j API.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe RMM spdlog sink should be replaced immediately after startup with a sink that can log to slf4j.  This allows the user to customize at runtime how the RMM logs should be handled, whether that's sent to a file, stderr, or some other, custom logging handler.  See https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm/issues/564#issuecomment-822964167 for details on how the RMM spdlog sink can be updated.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could simply emit these error messages to stderr, but using slf4j would be more flexible for applications.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTE1Nzg5NA==","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
