Current examples of behaviour:\r\n```cpp\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 2, 1, 1, ???); // gets you [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 2, 1, 1, min); //            1,        1,         2,         3,       4\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 2, 1, 1, max); //            2,        3,         4,         5,       5 \r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 2, 1, 1, sum); //            3,        6,         9,        12,       9\r\n\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 1, 1, ???); // gets you [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 1, 1, min); //            1,      2,      3,      4,     5\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 1, 1, max); //            2,      3,      4,      5,     5\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 1, 1, sum); //            3,      5,      7,      9,     5\r\n\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 0, 1, ???); // gets you [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 0, 1, min); //           1,   2,   3,   4,   5\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 0, 1, max); //           1,   2,   3,   4,   5\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 0, 1, sum); //           1,   2,   3,   4,   5\r\n```\r\nRecommendation would be that all of the `preceding` parameters we be \"reduce by 1\" and the current index would be included by default. Therefore window length would always be `preceding` + `following` + 1. However, need to consider the API that takes a column of window sizes and also the future changes @mythrocks will make.\r\n\r\n**Previous discussion:**\r\n* https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/3305#discussion_r352659894\r\n* https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/3305#discussion_r353878021 \r\n\r\n**Relevant SQL Links:**\r\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15\r\n* https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/learn-sql-server/window-functions-in-sql-server-part-2-the-frame/","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTg0MjgyOQ==","author":{"login":"harrism"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Another important current example:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, ???); // null, null, null, null, null\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, min); // null, null, null, null, null\r\netc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just worked through the logic of some corner cases, and thought I would document it to help improve understanding and help others work examples. Here's the current logic for computing the window start and end.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nsize_type preceding_window = preceding_window_begin[i];\r\nsize_type following_window = following_window_begin[i];\r\n\r\n// compute bounds\r\nsize_type start       = min(input.size(), max(0, i - preceding_window + 1));\r\nsize_type end         = min(input.size(), max(0, i + following_window + 1));\r\nsize_type start_index = min(start, end);\r\nsize_type end_index   = max(start, end); \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the window processing loops all look like `for (size_type j = start_index; j < end_index; j++) { ... }`  -- so `end_index` is not included.\r\n\r\nI guess what is being proposed is to change it so that passing [0, 0, 1] for preceding, following, min_periods gives you the identity, rather than the current behavior where [1, 0, 1] gives you the identity. So my first attempt at the new logic would be:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nsize_type preceding_window = preceding_window_begin[i];\r\nsize_type following_window = following_window_begin[i];\r\n\r\n// compute bounds\r\nsize_type start       = min(input.size(), max(0, i - preceding_window));\r\nsize_type end         = min(input.size(), max(0, i + following_window + 1));\r\nsize_type start_index = min(start, end);\r\nsize_type end_index   = max(start, end); \r\n```\r\n(Leaving the processing loop alone.)\r\nNotably, my example above would now produce non-null results. \r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, ???); // [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, min); //  1,   2,   3,   4,   5\r\netc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo recover the previous zero-window-size behavior would require passing `-1` for *either* one of the window sizes.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, 0, 1, ???); // null, null, null, null, null\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, -1, 1, ???); // null, null, null, null, null\r\n```\r\nBut (I think surprisingly), passing `-1` for both would be the same as passing zero for both!\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, -1, 1, ???); // [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would think that (-1, -1) should result in the reverse of (1, 1).  This makes me think that we would instead want to change the implementation to this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nsize_type preceding_window = preceding_window_begin[i];\r\nsize_type following_window = following_window_begin[i];\r\n\r\n// compute bounds\r\nsize_type start       = min(input.size() - 1, max(0, i - preceding_window));\r\nsize_type end         = min(input.size() - 1, max(0, i + following_window));\r\nsize_type start_index = min(start, end);\r\nsize_type end_index   = max(start, end); \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd change the for loop to be inclusive. `for (size_type j = start_index; j <= end_index; j++) { ... }`\r\n\r\nImportant to also note the changes to the first argument to `min()` for `start` and `end`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\n\r\n// 0, 0, 1 still gives the identity\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, ???); // [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\n\r\n// Note the difference here: \r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, 0, 1, ???); // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, -1, 1, ???); // [1], [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5]\r\n\r\n// The above are the same as the reversed, negated windows (this seems consistent)\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 1, 1, ???); // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 0, 1, ???); // [1], [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5]\r\n\r\n// -1 twice is the same as 1 twice, as expected\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 1, 1, ???);   // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, -1, 1, ???); // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now how do we do a zero window size? The only way is to set `min_periods` greater than 1.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 2, ???);   // null, null, null, null, null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis kind of bothers me, but at least there is a way. And the rest of the cases are more self consistent than other implementations.\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2021-01-07T02:29:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/7093#issuecomment-755842829","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTg0Njk3Nw==","author":{"login":"harrism"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"BTW, I found the original negative window sizes request. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/3650\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the reason for the request was to enable windows that DO NOT include the current row/element.

For instance, consider this column:\r\n```\r\n// auto col = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};\r\n```\r\nConsider a `SUM()` operation over records in a span [`2 ROWS PRECEDING`, `1 ROW PRECEDING`]. All the rows participating in a window appear before (i.e. to the left) of the current row. E.g. For row at index `5`, the sum is `7` (i.e. `3+4`). \r\nAssuming the current semantics of `preceding`/`following`, we might represent this as:\r\n```\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 3, -1, 1, sum); // {ω, 0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will need to add checks so that the left bound do not appear to the right of the right bound. (E.g. `rolling_window(col 3, -3, ?, ???)`.)\r\n\r\nThis gets slightly more involved for timestamp-based queries, where the window might be from `7 DAYS PRECEDING` to `1 DAY PRECEDING`.","createdAt":"2021-01-11T23:22:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/7093#issuecomment-758287090","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MDA5MzMwOQ==","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked stale due to no recent activity in the past 30d.
