Please describe.**\r\nSupport lists of lists and multiple nested lists + structs in serial mumur3 and md5 hash functions.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCurrently lists are supported, but not lists of lists or lists containing structs. Expand and improve the current implementation to handle these complex nested types.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWould rely on #9119 in some way, both are part of a larger effort of supporting nested lists/structs better.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xqGd","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
