The former can be removed.\r\n2. The older `rolling_window()` and `grouped_rolling_window()` methods took `preceding`/`following` bounds as `size_type`. The `bounds` concept was generalized to a `window_bounds` class, to incorporate `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`/`UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`. The older methods can be deprecated in favour of the newer ones.\r\n3. Certain window functions (E.g. `LEAD`/`LAG`) allow for default values. Instead of a separate function with the extra parameter, we should consolidate to a single function with an optional parameter.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-04-03T21:27:32Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5ig73w","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3NTAz","name":"2 - In Progress","description":"Currently a work in progress","color":"fef2c0"}],"milestone":null,"number":13050,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[TASK] Remove deprecated/unnecessary rolling-window overloads","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T18:02:05Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13050"}
