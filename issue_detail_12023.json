Please describe.**\r\nPandas has supported the `how=\"cross\"` option in `join`/`merge` [since `pandas-1.2`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html). Using this option creates the cartesian product from both frames, preserving the order of the left-hannd keys. I propose that we support this option in `cudf`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/6755, this behavior can already be accomplished using a place-holder column and an inner merge. The quickest way to resolve this issue is to use this workaround automatically within the cudf merge/join API. The \"best\" solution is to add a primitive in libcudf (if one doesn't already exist?).\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5NaVry","author":{"login":"shwina"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just for completeness: libcudf does support cross joins, so we would just need to plumb it through to Python:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/7af461cd0a4b616932e2766050a87d4cc82cd963/cpp/include/cudf/join.hpp#L254\r\n","createdAt":"2022-11-01T15:55:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12023#issuecomment-1298750194","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-10-28T15:04:26Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5VFFZO","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQxMjEz","name":"cuDF (Python)","description":"Affects Python cuDF API.","color":"1d76db"}],"milestone":null,"number":12023,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Support how=\"cross\" in merge/join","updatedAt":"2022-11-01T15:55:43Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12023"}
