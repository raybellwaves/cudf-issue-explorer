Please describe.**\r\n\r\n(Seen as part of a review of #14470).\r\n\r\nMultiindex codes and levels are effectively a categorical encoding of the columns of the multiindex entries. The codes are used to index the levels. As such, they should probably have type equivalent to `cudf::size_type`. Currently, however, they are a int64. This is a larger memory footprint than necessary. Moreover, it (in some constructor circumstances) necessitates more copies than necessary.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nUse correct dtype. Since the public `codes` and `levels` properties wrap the results in pandas `FrozenList` objects to mimic the pandas API, it may be possible to just store the codes/levels pairs as `CategoricalColumn`s internally, rather than the current structure.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nn/a","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-22T14:23:32Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps53mCl3","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDOBWUGps8AAAABc-htjg","name":"no-oom","description":"Reducing memory footprint of cudf algorithms","color":"FBCA04"}],"milestone":null,"number":14472,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Check dtype requirements on multiindex codes","updatedAt":"2023-11-22T14:24:42Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14472"}
