Internally, we use the same values.  But it is a very unwieldy way to think about things.  I think it would be easier to immediately convert those values to `start_row` and `end_row` and use that everywhere.  It's a nontrivial amount of work to do this without causing bugs but I think the code would be more natural (in the std::algorithms / iterator sense of the word).","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-21T20:35:55Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps53gyuj","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQ0MTQy","name":"cuIO","description":"cuIO issue","color":"fef2c0"}],"milestone":{"number":22,"title":"Parquet continuous improvement","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":14465,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Parquet reader:  replace skip_rows / num_rows with start_row / end_row","updatedAt":"2024-02-16T23:02:47Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14465"}
