Please describe.**\r\nUp until now we've always returned host side numpy scalars when a user pulls an item out of a cuDF series or index using `the_object[idx]`, `loc` or similar. This was originally to match pandas. However now that we have structured types the concern becomes that this incurs a potentially expensive device to host copy if the data in a column with a structured dtype is sufficiently wide, such as in the case of long lists. We should experiment with returning device side values, noting however that we'll probably need to do the same for all our dtypes. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n`cudf.Series([42])[0] == cudf.Scalar(42)`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently the approach is to copy everything to host.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xqL0","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
