See https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11575#discussion_r953925683. I suspect this is also true for list and struct accessors but have not verified that.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDoctests should run for type-accessors inheriting from `ColumnMethods` like `Series.str.findall`.\r\n\r\nThis will probably require some updates to [test_doctests.py](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/main/python/cudf/cudf/tests/test_doctests.py) to ensure that these accessor methods are found and tested. It may require a special set of tests explicitly designed for finding and testing all `ColumnMethods` objects.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5K7Wc3","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
