To me, this is a violation of \"different values hash differently\". The scale is a piece of column metadata but I think it's relevant to the hash computation because hashes are typically used as a proxy for equivalent representations. I think this could be considered a bug. My proposal would be to combine the column scale into the hash of the value.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @bdice in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13612#discussion_r1264530164_\r\n            ","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-07-17T16:16:17Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5rxaBA","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3OTIx","name":"proposal","description":"Change current process or code","color":"2a2c89"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"}],"milestone":null,"number":13705,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Should cudf hashes decimal values the same regardless of scale?","updatedAt":"2023-07-17T16:17:00Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13705"}
