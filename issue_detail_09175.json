Sometimes, we may want to operate on multiple sources/destinations so it would be great if we can support that. In such cases, the input iterators into these APIs would be a zip iterator or a pair of iterators pointing to `{column_index, row_index}` of the source/destination tables (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/9130#discussion_r701405591).

I had a similar requirement in a previous PR (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/5779), where I wanted to scatter values from a single column into multiple columns in a table.\r\n\r\nI'm also just making the observation that if we ever supported the notion of \"chunked\" columns in libcudf, the regular `scatter` and `gather` APIs would suffice for all the use cases you mentioned, as we would then easily be able to convert tables <-> chunked columns.","createdAt":"2021-09-02T21:50:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/9175#issuecomment-912082973","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xqC8","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
