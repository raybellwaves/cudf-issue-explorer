Please describe.**\r\nCurrently we support `castTo` on primitive data types. This request is to extend this functionality/operator to nested types like lists, structs, and list of structs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOne should be able to call a cudf function to cast an `array(floats)` for example to an `array(doubles)`. We should also allow other valid casts that we support today to nested type category.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjgxMjIzNg==","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
