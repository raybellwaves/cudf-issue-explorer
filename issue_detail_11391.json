Because its name is so generic, it doesn't play nice with users who might want to create their own, more appropriately named `make_column` that does some other work along the way.  Changing this to `column_from_column_buffer()` or `make_column_from_buffer()`, or maybe making it a member of `column_buffer` would clean things up a bit\r\n\r\n Eg.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// user function (in parquet code for example)\r\nmake_column(column_buffer &b)\r\n{\r\n    // random preprocessing work\r\n    auto x = column_from_column_buffer(b);\r\n    // random postprocessing work\r\n}\r\n```","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5JRIlA","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
