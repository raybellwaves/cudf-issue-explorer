Please describe.**\r\nWhen building a cudf AST expression in Java, sometimes there are cases where a `Scalar` instance already exists for a literal.  The current Java bindings do not allow a `Scalar` to be used directly, so one must synchronize and fetch the validity and value to manually construct a corresponding AST `Literal` instance.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe Java bindings should allow for an AST `Literal` instance to take a `Scalar` argument as the literal value to use, which will include both the validity and value.  No synchronization is necessary for this constructor.  When compiled, the resulting `CompiledExpression` instance should increment the reference count of the `Scalar` instance, as it is being actively referenced by the compiled AST, and closing the `CompiledExpression` should close the corresponding `Scalar` instance.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps49cn5x","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
