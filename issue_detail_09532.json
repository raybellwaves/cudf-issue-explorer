Please describe.**\r\nIn [spark-rapids-ml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-ml), it is common(to build a matrix-like data) to build new `fixed row length` ColumnVector of LIST type, with a device memory buffer. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nimagine there's a result memory buffer `void* ret` to be returned. cuDF should be able to create a fixed length ColumnVector of LIST type with number of rows and number of columns provided.\r\ne.g. the result memory is [1,2,3,4,5,6], with number of rows=3, number of cols=2, then cuDF provides a method to give out a CV with data layout like: \r\n\r\n[1,2]\r\n[3,4]\r\n[5,6]\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nit can be done either in native or java.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps47H7fq","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
