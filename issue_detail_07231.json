Please describe.**\r\nLike ROW_NUMBER, which supported in PR 4881, FIRST_VALUE is widely used window function in sql. So, we want to provide it for BlazingSQL. FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE are fairly trivial where there are no partitions to worry about, but if you have multiple groups or partitions, for the case of `grouped_rolling_window`, then its not so trivial, and we would want native support for that aggregator in cudf.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplementation of the aggregation for FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE, especially for `grouped_rolling_window`\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTIxMDIyMA==","author":{"login":"revans2"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would it make since to use the existing make_nth_element_aggregation for this?
