Please describe.**\r\nDuring https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13729 we were able to round out the 4 and 8 byte dtypes supported by the groupby JIT engine, however shorter types such as `int8` and `int16` couldn't be added due to the missing support for those types from certain `libcu++` features we rely on in the shim library. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should provide block level implementations for these types in c++ that don't rely on the particular libcu++ features.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could also wait for libcu++ to provide things like `atomic_ref` for shorter types. \r\n\r\ncc @bwyogatama @PointKernel \r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5iOzsN","author":{"login":"PointKernel"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Related to https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/issues/1024","createdAt":"2023-07-24T14:41:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13736#issuecomment-1648048909","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-07-24T14:06:17Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5sZCr_","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE2MzIwNzI3","name":"numba","description":"Numba issue","color":"9c2cdd"}],"milestone":null,"number":13736,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Support <4 byte types in `GroupBy.apply` with `engine='jit'`","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T18:02:32Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13736"}
