Instead it is about creating an empty column according to the nested data type, not a scalar.\r\n\r\nThe key point for this issue is how to pass the nested data type to the native via JNI.","createdAt":"2021-05-25T02:59:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/8178#issuecomment-847492156","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xqMx","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
