Please describe.**\r\nI'd like to have the ability to pass on the index columns aswell through `orc` files. We do this incase of `parquet` but not `orc`. When we roundtrip a dataframe from cudf `orc` writer & reader, the index data is lost:\r\n```python\r\n>>> df = cudf.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3]}, index=['a', 'b', 'c'])\r\n>>> df\r\n   a\r\na  1\r\nb  2\r\nc  3\r\n>>> df.to_orc('sample.orc')\r\n>>> cudf.read_orc('sample.orc')\r\n   a\r\n0  1\r\n1  2\r\n2  3\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe might have to uniquely name the index columns and write and retrieve them in libcudf layer.\r\n\r\ncc: @vuule @rgsl888prabhu \r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xp8w","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
