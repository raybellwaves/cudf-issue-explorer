However, when we want to access the sliced children column (in many places), we have to do that manually. It would be great if we can cache the sliced children and provide iterators `sliced_child_begin()` and `sliced_child_end()` that allow quickly iterating over them.\r\n\r\nSince different classes (`structs_column_view` and `lists_column_view`) have different interfaces for generating `column_view` of sliced child, we may have to implement the proposed iterators separately in these classes instead of implementing in the `column_view` base class.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps47FWR_","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
