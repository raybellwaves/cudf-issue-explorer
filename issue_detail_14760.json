This should be configured globally somewhere.\r\n\r\n             I'm thinking about whether we should parse `percent_of_free_device_memory` from some env variable, instead of hard coding like this in many places. By doing so we can control the number we want at runtime.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @ttnghia in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14741#discussion_r1448304244_\r\n            ","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-15T20:47:27Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps58Itb3","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":14760,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Initial pool size should not be hard coded","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T20:47:40Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14760"}
