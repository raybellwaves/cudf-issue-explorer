The new hasher was tested by incorporating it into the implementation of `cudf::distinct`. Now that the functionality for `cudf::distinct` has been expanded by the use of this new hasher, we should add tests for some new cases, as was pointed out in some discussion threads on that PR:\r\n- [X] We should add tests of tests with sliced input for both structs and lists input columns (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/10641#discussion_r858037209)\r\n- [X] We should add tests for simple nested cases like `List<Struct<...>>` and `Struct<List<...>>` to ensure that the new nesting behavior really works as expected (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/10641#discussion_r853494994)\r\n- [ ] We should add at least one test of a more complex nested case (e.g. `List<List<Struct<List<...>>>>`) to potentially help catch unexpected errors (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/10641#discussion_r853494994)\r\n\r\nAdding these tests will be helpful to validate the behavior of the new row hasher.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5CLFFp","author":{"login":"vyasr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ttnghia I've assigned you since you made this request, but feel free to change that if necessary.","createdAt":"2022-04-26T20:07:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/10742#issuecomment-1110200681","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5CLHdu","author":{"login":"vyasr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bdice I've updated the issue to include some of your testing requests and assigned you as well.","createdAt":"2022-04-26T20:18:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/10742#issuecomment-1110210414","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-04-26T20:06:35Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5IgR6i","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE2MzQyNTY3","name":"tests","description":"Unit testing for project","color":"204ea3"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ2NTIxMDI0","name":"improvement","description":"Improvement / enhancement to an existing function","color":"bfd4f2"}],"milestone":null,"number":10742,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Other Issues"},"column":{"name":"Needs prioritizing"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Additional tests for cudf::distinct using the new row hasher","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T17:59:25Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/10742"}
