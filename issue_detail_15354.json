Specifically, we'd like to make a utility available in the JNI code so that classes that need to invoke `onClosed` can do so with the same common code.\r\n\r\n              This is now inconsistent with (Host)ColumnVector. If we cannot consistently move eventHandler.onClosed into a finally please add a comment, but hopefully we can and it could be generalized via some utls withEventHandler(eventHandler) or base class implementation.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @gerashegalov in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/15351#discussion_r1532615825_\r\n            ","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-03-20T19:18:53Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6DCH0D","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":15354,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[JNI] Cleanup MemoryBuffer/ColumnVector close methods to use common code","updatedAt":"2024-03-20T19:20:38Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15354"}
