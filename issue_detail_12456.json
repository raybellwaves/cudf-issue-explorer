There is a lot of commonality in `device_write` and `host_write`. It would be good to move the common bit out to its own function.\r\n2. `rotate_buffer()` could stand to have a better name.\r\n3. `jni_writer_data_sink` should probably move to the `cudf::jni::io` namespace.\r\n4. If moved to the appropriate namespace, `jni_writer_data_sink` need no longer reference `jni_` in its name.\r\n5. `device_write_async()` might need implementing. It might simply be a matter of calling `device_write` via `std::async`. This is not currently exercised.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-12-30T19:48:56Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5aSZ-A","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ1NjIz","name":"cuDF (Java)","description":"Affects Java cuDF API.","color":"006b75"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ2OTc1","name":"Spark","description":"Functionality that helps Spark RAPIDS","color":"7400ff"}],"milestone":null,"number":12456,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Other Issues"},"column":{"name":"Backlog"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Refactor JNI `jni_writer_data_sink`","updatedAt":"2022-12-31T00:31:19Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12456"}
