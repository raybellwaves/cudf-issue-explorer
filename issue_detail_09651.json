As a result, when we want to replace `-NaN` or `-0.0` in a child column of a nested column, we have to manually recursively iterate over all the children columns of the given column, check to see whether the current child column is FLOAT32 or FLOAT64 type before calling to `normalize_nans_and_zeros`.\r\n\r\nWe should extend `normalize_nans_and_zeros` to do this automatically. In other words, it should accept an input column of any type.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps47FWRw","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
