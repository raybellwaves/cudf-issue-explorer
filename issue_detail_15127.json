I can pass a list of column labels though:\r\n```python\r\ncudf.read_csv(filepath, index_col=[0])\r\nKeyError: 'None of [0] are in the columns'\r\n\r\ncudf.read_csv(filepath, index_col=['family'])\r\n```\r\nWhile this is not a huge issue, I imagine the following is a common scenario: You have know that the first 3 columns are index columns, but you don't exactly know how each are spelt (`'date'` vs `'Date'` etc.). In this case, if passing a list of column indices were possible, `index_col=[0,1,2]` would have worked fine; otherwise, you will have to read the file without specifying index columns and set index later (or require trial and error to guess the column labels).\r\n\r\nIs it possible for `index_col` to accept list of indices like in pandas?","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps51GSdk","author":{"login":"shwina"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks - I think this should be somewhat easy to implement.
