These bugs can be fixed by simply padding the memory buffer back (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13586) but that is not an optimal, long-term solution. The permanent solution should be discovering why such padding is needed and whether we can avoid such padding altogether.\r\n\r\nWe should investigate further the issue to find a permanent solution.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-06-22T20:17:35Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5phTHG","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQ0MTQy","name":"cuIO","description":"cuIO issue","color":"fef2c0"}],"milestone":null,"number":13605,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Investigate why padding is needed for input buffers to compression/decompression kernels","updatedAt":"2023-07-22T20:15:59Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13605"}
