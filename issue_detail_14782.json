Here's what we have so far: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/compare/branch-24.02...abellina:cudf:ab-pinned-pool.\r\n\r\nWe would like to make architecture decisions on how we could use the pinned pool, perhaps the single one created for the JNI side of things, to be shared with cuIO https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14314.\r\n\r\nIt would be great or us to try and repro this https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12341.
