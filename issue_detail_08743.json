Please describe.**\r\nCategorical column indexes exists in a weird place of quasi-support in cuDF; while it is possible to set a dataframe's column index to be a `pd.CategoricalIndex` without any error or warning, it isn't actually possible for the index to be recreated with `df.columns`, which contrasts the behavior of Pandas:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport cudf\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\npdf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": [1, 2, 3], \"b\": [4, 5, 6]})\r\npdf.columns = pdf.columns.astype(\"category\")\r\n\r\ngdf = cudf.from_pandas(pdf)\r\n\r\nprint(pdf.columns)  # CategoricalIndex(['a', 'b'], categories=['a', 'b'], ordered=False, dtype='category')\r\nprint(gdf.columns)  # Index(['a', 'b'], dtype='object')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that while there are user-facing issues which come as a result of using cuDF's \"categorical\" column indexes (such as #7365), the ability to test for them is limited in that we cannot do the standard comparison to Pandas dataframes here:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom cudf.testing._utils import assert_eq\r\n\r\nassert_eq(pdf, gdf)  # AssertionError: DataFrame.columns are different\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAfter chatting with @shwina, it seems like an ideal solution that *can't* be done here is to use the individual categorical scalars instead of their string names as data when constructing the `ColumnAccessor` in the [columns setter method](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/0e2a448e15eec4b6d5d20f469a6f79be2f31b923/python/cudf/cudf/core/dataframe.py#L2676-L2704). However, this isn't possible, as neither Pandas nor cuDF offer categorical scalars.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this would be to have a boolean attribute either of the dataframe or `ColumnAccessor` saying whether or not the column index is categorical; this could then be used by `ColumnAccessor.to_pandas_index()`to properly reconstruct the index with categories if needed. This would come with its own consequences, specifically either\r\n\r\n- a relatively niche param/attribute of `ColumnAccessor` that is only used for dataframes\r\n- an attribute of dataframes that now must be explicitly copied from one to another in the case of copies\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA possible alternative that @shwina and I explored, but were unable to get working, is to pass specific kwargs to `assert_eq` such that it would only check the column index names, but not the index type. Passing different combos of `check_categorical=False`, `check_column_type=False`, etc. we were unable to get a passing test when comparing these indexes.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis issue came up while working on #8560, where added test cases would require this feature and needed to be xfailed.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps45xp6y","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
