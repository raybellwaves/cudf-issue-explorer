Please describe.**\r\nNo. I just noticed there wasn't an issue for [`DatetimeIndex.indexer_between_time`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py#L764). I also enjoyed the user experience that `%%cudf.pandas.profile` points users to raise issues to highlight pandas API that falls back to CPU (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.06/python/cudf/cudf/pandas/profiler.py#L300).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\npd.date_range(\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-01-02\", freq=\"1h\").indexer_between_time(\"09:00\", \"16:00\")\r\nimport cudf\r\ncudf.date_range(\"2023-01-01\", \"2023-01-02\", freq=\"1h\").indexer_between_time(\"09:00\", \"16:00\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere may be a cudf work around in the meantime for a user who needs indexer_between_time that could be captured at https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/cudf_pandas/\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n~~Could create a new issue template with the \"pandas\" label (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Apandas) to be used at https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.06/python/cudf/cudf/pandas/profiler.py#L297~~ fixed a bug at https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/15381\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps54Mel1","author":{"login":"shwina"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @raybellwaves!\r\n\r\nI think this could be implemented in terms of the existing datetime methods. For instance, `idx.indexer_between_time('09:00', '17:00')` would be `9 <= idx.dt.hour < 17` - unless I'm missing something. \r\n\r\nThis would make a great contribution if you (or anyone else) is interested in taking it on!
