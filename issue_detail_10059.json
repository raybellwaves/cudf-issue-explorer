Please describe.**\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nWhile porting some code from Pandas to cuDF, I have noticed that cuDF series do not support `unstack` method.\r\nAs an additional request, It would be great if `fill_values` could be supported in both `cudf.DataFrame.unstack` and `cudf.Series.unstack` methods. Thanks!\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTo have that method supported in cuDF series.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCreating a cuDF DataFrame from the cuDF series, use `unstack` on the DataFrame.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps48uixL","author":{"login":"beckernick"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This could possibly be implemented with the existing `cudf.core.reshape.unstack`, following a similar approach to `cudf.dataframe.unstack`.
