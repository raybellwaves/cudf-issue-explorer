Some functions accept a list for both order and null precedence (e.g. `libcudf.sort.sort`); some accept a list for order but only a single value for null precedence (e.g. `libcudf.sort.order_by`); some accept a list for neither order nor null precedence (e.g. `libcudf.search.search_sorted`).\r\n\r\nThis should be cleaned up and all such functions should uniformly accept a list for both order and null precedence. Higher-level python functions that operate on single columns and call the table interfaces should be responsible for any argument munging.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5zXD8z","author":{"login":"MananDoshi1301"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"If this issue is still open and relevant, I would like to give it a try @wence- \r\nThank you!","createdAt":"2024-02-09T07:00:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14492#issuecomment-1935425331","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5ztLVt","author":{"login":"shwina"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @MananDoshi1301 - we are in the process of refactoring our Cython internals.
