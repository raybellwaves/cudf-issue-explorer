It's not quite that simple, although it's close. You'll need to build the documentation with the checks turned on (that's how you run it), but then you will also need to fix any issues that it finds. [Here are the instructions on building the docs](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/tree/branch-22.08/docs/cudf). My recommendation would probably be to clone the repository and install the conda environment as it recommends, but instead of building cudf from source just try to install cudf from the `rapidsai-nightly` conda channel so that you get the most up-to-date version of the package without having to build it yourself. Then you should be able to start from step 2 on that page and build the documentation as described. Does that make sense?

The `numpydoc` website has [a full list of error codes](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html#built-in-validation-checks) to explain what each of these are. Since these all do look like real errors, my recommendation would be to pick one or two of the above error codes at a time, find all of the issues, and make a PR fixing just that issue.
