Also Spark has requirements to treat quoted and unquoted strings differently for essentially all data types, so the schema we pass to the JSON parser has all strings at the leaf nodes. So this can end up being a very common problem, and we have no way to detect it and fall back to the CPU because the issue is in the data, not in anything we have access to at planning time.","createdAt":"2024-03-14T13:21:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15278#issuecomment-1997449150","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-03-12T16:23:15Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6CEFuE","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ2OTc1","name":"Spark","description":"Functionality that helps Spark RAPIDS","color":"7400ff"}],"milestone":null,"number":15278,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Support casting of LIST type to STRING in JSON","updatedAt":"2024-03-14T13:21:09Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15278"}
