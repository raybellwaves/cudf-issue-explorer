Please describe.**\r\nSome users of the RAPIDS Accelerator plugin for Apache Spark are not matching the correct versions of cudf with the plugin resulting in `NoSuchMethodError` exceptions and other errors.  It would be nice if the plugin could query cudf, either via a properties resource file in the jar or via a formal Java API, to get details about the cudf build such as:\r\n- cudf version\r\n- CUDA runtime version it was compiled against\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA simple properties file containing key/value pairs that can be looked up probably would be sufficient.  We can wrap that properties file with a cudf Java API that returns the properties as a map of key/values to abstract the implementation details a bit if desired.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSeparate APIs for each build or configuration setting is another way to handle this but can quickly explode the API footprint.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MDEyMzU0Ng==","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked rotten due to no recent activity in the past 90d.
