The main diverging part of the implementation mostly lies in column selection (handling index columns and user inputs). For some methods (such as `_apply_boolean_mask`), which unconditionally pass in all columns for `index`/`indexed_frame`, we should be able to merge common code path while dispatching just the column selection part to each object to reduce code duplication.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps4-L6Wi","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
