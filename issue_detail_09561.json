Please describe.**\r\nThis issue is created as a follow-up to #9571  and #9554 where we add support for ceil/floor operations for `datetime64[ns]` data type. In this case, we would like additional support for `timedelta64[ns]` types as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n```python\r\nimport cudf\r\ntdIndex = cudf.TimedeltaIndex(data =['4 day 8h 20min 35us 45ns', '+17:42:19.999999',\r\n'9 day 3h 08:16:02.000055', '+22:35:25.000075'])\r\ntdIndex.ceil(freq='T'))\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```bash\r\nTimedeltaIndex(['4 days 08:21:00', '0 days 17:43:00', '9 days 11:17:00',\r\n'0 days 22:36:00'],\r\ndtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSimilar [to how pandas supports it](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.TimedeltaIndex.ceil.html?pandas.TimedeltaIndex.ceil#pandas-timedeltaindex-ceil)","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps47H7fh","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
