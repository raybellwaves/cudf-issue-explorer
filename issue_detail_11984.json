Please describe.**\r\nBy default Spark uses an escape character `\\` to escape things like double quotes within other double quotes i.e. `\"\\\"\"`. Pandas by default uses two double quotes right next to each other.  Spark does not support this method of escaping.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe would like an option in the csv reader setting to allow setting an escape character. There should be an option to either disable the double double quote escaping, or have it automatically disabled if an escape character is provided.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nwrite our own CSV parser.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-10-25T14:13:10Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5UyjP5","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQ0MTQy","name":"cuIO","description":"cuIO issue","color":"fef2c0"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ2OTc1","name":"Spark","description":"Functionality that helps Spark RAPIDS","color":"7400ff"}],"milestone":{"number":12,"title":"CSV continuous improvement","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":11984,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Feature Planning"},"column":{"name":"Needs prioritizing"}},{"project":{"name":"v23.02 Release"},"column":{"name":"Issue-P0"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Add support for escape characters in CSV","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T16:18:58Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/11984"}
