That is, if you have two files `[f1, f2]` and the row groups within the files (in one column) are specified as `[[r0,r3], [r0,r1]]`, do we guarantee the output ordering would be  `[f1r0, f1r3, f2r0, f2r1]`\r\n\r\nThe code does in fact do this for both the explicitly specified case and the unspecified (empty user input / all row groups), but we don't make any guarantees about it.   Seems like a safe and easy thing to add.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/5d244dfc13f4db0b1e41ded3029942fec50c98f6/cpp/src/io/parquet/reader_impl_helpers.cpp#L663\r\n\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-07T21:27:02Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6IJwrW","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQ0MTQy","name":"cuIO","description":"cuIO issue","color":"fef2c0"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ2NTIxMDI0","name":"improvement","description":"Improvement / enhancement to an existing function","color":"bfd4f2"}],"milestone":null,"number":15697,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Explicitly guarantee row group ordering in the parquet reader.","updatedAt":"2024-05-19T03:55:47Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15697"}
