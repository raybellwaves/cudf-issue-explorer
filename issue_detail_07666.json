At the moment, cuDF doesn't support this functionality out of the box. We support a `rolling.apply` API, but it's currently not designed to operate on multiple columns at once. To do something like this today, you'd likely need to do something like write a custom numba kernel.\r\n\r\nI'm going to update this issue to file this as a feature request.","createdAt":"2021-07-09T13:53:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/7666#issuecomment-877206360","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps49geRW","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-90d` due to no recent activity in the past 90 days.
