No tests were added as part of the fix, because the crash is elusive. There already are tests for grouped time-range rolling windows that exercise this code path, but do not crash on account of the out-of-bounds access. \r\n\r\nIt would be good to add a test that reproduces the error condition.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5Nzg1NTY5Ng==","author":{"login":"jrhemstad"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/904 is something that would have helped in this situation as well.
