Please describe.**\r\nCython offers various small bits of functionality that reduce overhead in various scenarios. We should test some of these out.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFeatures to test:\r\n- [ ] Apply `cython.final` decorator to classes. This will reduce the overhead of `cpdef` methods by removing the need to look up child classes.\r\n- [ ] Use `cython.freelist` for objects that may be created and freed often. Good examples would be lightweight objects like `pylibcudf.aggregation.Aggregation`s\r\n- [ ] Add `not None` to parameters that must be provided so that they can be checked cheaply at runtime.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-24T01:14:36Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6ARSW6","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzIyMjUyNjE3","name":"Performance","description":"Performance related issue","color":"C2E0C6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOBWUGps8AAAABoeP23w","name":"pylibcudf","description":"Issues specific to the pylibcudf package","color":"e99695"}],"milestone":null,"number":15137,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Explore using Cython language features that allow minimizing overhead and simplifying code","updatedAt":"2024-05-28T23:33:44Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15137"}
