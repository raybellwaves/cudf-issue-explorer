This means that any updates to correctness/performance of `DataFrame.isin` must be hand-ported to the `MultiIndex` case.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n`MultiIndex.isin` should do necessary pre-/post-processing and call `DataFrame.isin` rather than re-implementing the core algorithm.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-22T19:05:26Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps53n8UJ","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzIyMjUyNjE3","name":"Performance","description":"Performance related issue","color":"C2E0C6"}],"milestone":null,"number":14480,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Remove special-case implementation of `MultiIndex.isin`","updatedAt":"2023-11-22T19:05:26Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14480"}
