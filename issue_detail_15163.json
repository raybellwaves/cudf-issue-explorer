Please describe.**\r\nThere is currently no way to run cuDF operations in a stream-ordered manner. Since cuDF is deeply tied to the pandas API, there are also limits to how much stream-ordering may be exposed in the public API. pylibcudf has no such restrictions and should allow complete control over streams.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nlibcudf APIs are being incrementally modified to support stream-ordering. Once #13744 is complete, pylibcudf should expose the same functionality in its APIs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n#13087 and #13509 are examples of where stream-ordered Python APIs could be useful.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-27T23:49:33Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6AnZHP","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDOBWUGps8AAAABoeP23w","name":"pylibcudf","description":"Issues specific to the pylibcudf package","color":"e99695"}],"milestone":null,"number":15163,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Expose stream-ordered APIs in pylibcudf","updatedAt":"2024-05-28T23:33:44Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15163"}
