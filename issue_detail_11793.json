{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk1OTMw","is_bot":false,"login":"nvdbaranec","name":""},"body":"In the parquet reader there are two similar-sounding but distinct pieces of terminology:\r\n\r\n- Nested columns.  This is the same as in the cudf sense.  Anything involving structs or lists at any level.\r\n- Nested hierarchies.  This only involves columns (or _parts_ of columns) that contain lists (represented via repetition levels).\r\n\r\nThis causes confusion and bugs for a couple of reasons. A given (cudf) output column can contain both nested and non-nested hierarchies.  For example:\r\n```\r\n         A (struct)\r\n       /   \\\r\n      B     C (list)\r\n            |\r\n            D (int)\r\n```\r\nThis single output column contains two separate input column hierarchies.  A->B and A->C->D.  A->B does not contain repetition data and therefore is not a nested hierarchy.  A->C->D does contain repetition data and does constitute a nested hierarchy.  However they are _both_ nested in the cudf sense (more than 1 level deep).\r\n\r\nWe handle these two fundamental situations differently during the decoding process.  So if the two concepts get confused it can easily cause bugs.   \r\n\r\nIt would be great to do a pass that cleans this up in a comprehensive way.\r\n\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-09-27T19:07:05Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5SvsWJ","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3OTIx","name":"proposal","description":"Change current process or code","color":"2a2c89"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTg1MjQ0MTQy","name":"cuIO","description":"cuIO issue","color":"fef2c0"}],"milestone":{"number":22,"title":"Parquet continuous improvement","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":11793,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Feature Planning"},"column":{"name":"Needs prioritizing"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Parquet reader code cleanup, re:  nested columns vs columns with lists.","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T17:59:16Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/11793"}
