This would be a whole lot neater if `cudf::nullate` were used instead.\r\n\r\nThis would require `cudf::make_pair_rep_iterator` to support `nullate` first, which obfuscates the already drawn out change in #9510. The proposed switch to `cudf::nullate` will ideally be a focused change, handled separately.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps48EN7A","author":{"login":"github-actions"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been labeled `inactive-30d` due to no recent activity in the past 30 days.
