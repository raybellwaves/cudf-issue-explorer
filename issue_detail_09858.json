One parameter range goes from 1024 --> 67 million going up by a power of two each interval. This can easily be cut down by doing a power of 4. This approach can be applied to many of our biggest offenders in runtime.\r\n\r\n**Reduce the number of benchmarks that have an iteration count of <= 2**\r\n\r\nWe have benchmarks that are run a single time, which provides insufficient iterations to trust the results.\r\n\r\nIf valid for smaller data sizes, they should be be moved to do so.\r\nIf they need to run on larger datasize we need to switch them to NVBench, and state they need longer runtimes \r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5EM7gY","author":{"login":"vuule"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"related: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/10941","createdAt":"2022-06-01T23:22:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/9858#issuecomment-1144240152","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-12-07T18:53:20Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps4__s6u","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzIyMjUyNjE3","name":"Performance","description":"Performance related issue","color":"C2E0C6"}],"milestone":{"number":11,"title":"C++ Benchmark Runtime Improvements","description":"Refactor C++ Benchmarks to improve runtime performance.","dueOn":null},"number":9858,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Feature Planning"},"column":{"name":"Needs prioritizing"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Reduce benchmark search space where applicable","updatedAt":"2022-11-21T05:08:12Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/9858"}
