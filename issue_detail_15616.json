Also, use of `std::vector`s as the host mirror of device data (e.g. `make_device_uvector_async`, `make_std_vector_async`) can be replaced with a type backed with pinned memory, at least for buffers that are not in the same order of magnitude with the data size.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-04-30T02:10:04Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6HUr6A","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzIyMjUyNjE3","name":"Performance","description":"Performance related issue","color":"C2E0C6"}],"milestone":null,"number":15616,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Expand pinned memory use in libcudf","updatedAt":"2024-04-30T04:13:49Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15616"}
