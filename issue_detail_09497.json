Not a bug but having this may improve stability/reduce hidden bugs.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just realize that the current Java code is doing very well in handling null output from `getData`. If throwing exception on LIST/STRUCT type input, it is still not guaranteed that the output of other types will never be null. In addition, with exception being thrown, the callers also need to deal more with the complex type handling to not call `getData()` on LIST/STRUCT. Overall, this issue may not be very beneficial.","createdAt":"2022-11-19T22:40:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/9497#issuecomment-1320984775","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5RbPIm","author":{"login":"jlowe"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Agree this is pretty minor.  The Javadoc clearly states that it returns null if there's no buffer.  We could change the behavior to throw on no buffer instead of returning null.  I don't know how many other places are already coded against the existing functionality, handling the null themselves, and would break with a thrown exception.  Not sure this change is worth the risk of breakage.","createdAt":"2022-12-27T18:29:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/9497#issuecomment-1366094374","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-10-22T08:40:09Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps49l1ec","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1MTQ1NjIz","name":"cuDF (Java)","description":"Affects Java cuDF API.","color":"006b75"}],"milestone":null,"number":9497,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Feature Planning"},"column":{"name":"Needs prioritizing"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] enhancement: not allow getData from ColumnVector of nested type","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T18:42:42Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/9497"}
