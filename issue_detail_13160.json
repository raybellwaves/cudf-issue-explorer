Please describe.**\r\nThe scalar in libcudf does not provide a common interface to access values.\r\nEach type has their own scalar device view\r\nEg. `numeric_scalar_device_view`, `fixed_point_scalar_device_view`, `timestamp_scalar_device_view`, `duration_scalar_device_view`, `string_scalar_device_view`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCreate a _Generic Scalar device view_ to support both fixed width types and string types. List and Struct view types are out of scope now. This scalar device view should have element accessor, so that type dispatch in device works.\r\nThis will be useful for AST, and binary ops. (and any other operations where device side access of scalar is required). This may also replace existing type specific scalar device views.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nFixed width types have a type erased `fixed_width_scalar_device_view_base` which is used in AST.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFor string scalar support for AST https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13061, a new generic scalar is created in ast namespace for its usage.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-04-18T09:19:28Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5js22Q","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3OTIx","name":"proposal","description":"Change current process or code","color":"2a2c89"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQwNjY2","name":"libcudf","description":"Affects libcudf (C++/CUDA) code.","color":"c5def5"}],"milestone":null,"number":13160,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Add Generic scalar device view","updatedAt":"2023-06-07T20:53:56Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13160"}
