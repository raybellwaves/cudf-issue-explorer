Row groups\r\n    that do not match the given filter predicate are not read. The\r\n    predicate is expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF) like\r\n    `[[('x', '=', 0), ...], ...]`. DNF allows arbitrary boolean logical\r\n    combinations of single column predicates. The innermost tuples each\r\n    describe a single column predicate. The list of inner predicates is\r\n    interpreted as a conjunction (AND), forming a more selective and\r\n    multiple column predicate. Finally, the outermost list combines\r\n    these filters as a disjunction (OR). Predicates may also be passed\r\n    as a list of tuples. This form is interpreted as a single conjunction.\r\n    To express OR in predicates, one must use the (preferred) notation of\r\n    list of lists of tuples\r\n```\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5cgQGL","author":{"login":"shwina"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Related: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13334","createdAt":"2023-05-17T19:47:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13370#issuecomment-1551958411","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5eRBU1","author":{"login":"GregoryKimball"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would like to close this in favor of #12512","createdAt":"2023-06-07T21:12:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13370#issuecomment-1581520181","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-05-17T19:02:46Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5mMSrl","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3Nzk5","name":"0 - Waiting on Author","description":"Waiting for author to respond to review","color":"ffb88c"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQxMjEz","name":"cuDF (Python)","description":"Affects Python cuDF API.","color":"1d76db"}],"milestone":null,"number":13370,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Rename `filters=` argument to `row_group_filters=` in `read_parquet` and `read_orc` and provide examples that show its use","updatedAt":"2023-06-07T21:12:13Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13370"}
