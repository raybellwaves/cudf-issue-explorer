Please describe.**\r\nWe've encountered a few scenarios where we need to know whether an object is an cudf.pandas proxy object vs an actual cudf or pandas object e.g. https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/pull/5861#discussion_r1584001820\r\n\r\nThe classic `isinstance` does not work since proxy objects ensures this always returns `True` for the case above. Like the solution above, we're relied on checking attributes but this is not a sustainable long term solution as private attributes should be subject to change.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nExposing the proxy type in `cudf.pandas._types.`(?) that allows developers to explicitly check if they have a proxy object\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nChecking if proxy object attributes exist\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context, code examples, or references to existing implementations about the feature request here.\r\n","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-24T23:51:20Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps6KEZyf","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NjE=","name":"feature request","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM5NzQxMjEz","name":"cuDF (Python)","description":"Affects Python cuDF API.","color":"1d76db"},{"id":"LA_kwDOBWUGps8AAAABlj4eYg","name":"cudf.pandas","description":"Issues specific to cudf.pandas","color":"984DFB"}],"milestone":null,"number":15864,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[FEA] Add developer/private cudf.pandas API to check for proxy objects ","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T23:51:27Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15864"}
