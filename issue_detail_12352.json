{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgxNjU=","is_bot":false,"login":"vyasr","name":"Vyas Ramasubramani"},"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nThe `test_array_ufunc.py` module contains tests that I introduced in #10346 and #10217 that are intended to be generic for all ufuncs in `test_ufunc_(index|series|dataframe)`. However, the inputs are generated in exactly the same way for all ufuncs. This leads to some tests where all inputs are invalid, making some of the tests do nothing other than ensure that invalid inputs produce the same output. Some of the most egregious examples are inverse trigonometric functions arcsin and arccos, for which the domains are limited to (-1, 1) but all inputs are > 1.\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nRun the tests and check warnings.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe tests should be rewritten to generate inputs within the domain of the functions of choice, with perhaps just a few values outside the domain so that we can continue to validate consistent behavior in both cases. In an ideal world we would also update cudf to throw the same warnings as pandas here, but that may be more work than it's worth since we would almost certainly have to introspect the data.","closed":false,"closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOBWUGps5eDDMv","author":{"login":"GregoryKimball"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe this is still needed.","createdAt":"2023-06-06T03:47:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12352#issuecomment-1577857839","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-12-09T18:21:18Z","id":"I_kwDOBWUGps5YpR1a","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTk2MjY1NTk=","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDEzOTg3MzUy","name":"0 - Backlog","description":"In queue waiting for assignment","color":"d4c5f9"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE2MzMyOTQ4","name":"good first issue","description":"Good for newcomers","color":"7057ff"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE2MzQyNTY3","name":"tests","description":"Unit testing for project","color":"204ea3"}],"milestone":null,"number":12352,"projectCards":[{"project":{"name":"Bug Squashing"},"column":{"name":"Needs prioritizing"}}],"projectItems":[],"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[BUG] Tests of ufuncs should ensure values are in the right domain","updatedAt":"2023-06-06T03:47:41Z","url":"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12352"}
